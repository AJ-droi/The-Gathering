      "The Gathering has impacted me in so many ways. I'm an introvert, so at first I was skeptical of the whole thing (the people, activities ) but I decided to attend one and was so excited because I had lots of fun, got to meet with people, home my skills a bit and take nice pictures.I can't wait to be part of another.",

      "Hi, my name is king joseph, I am a mobile phone videographer and digital artist based in Port Harcourt city. To be frank, The Gathering is a community I would love to address as a positive collaboration of diverse talents, the reason I can boldly say this is because I am speaking from first hand experience. The first  time I ever came in contact with this amazing community was  the second half of 2021 , before then I was only into digital art although I had the urge to start videography as a career but I couldn't find motivation because I felt there was no value market for that industry in this part of the country. Well that was before I became a member of the community, getting to see different creative from various aspects really encouraged me to make my fist step in the videography and video editing space and ever since all I have experienced is personal growth. It's safe to say The gathering gave me that push I need.",

      "One of my heart's desires in 2020 was to meet creatives I resonated with. I had been a photographer all the while but my photography was stale. I'm still not living up to my potential creativelyâ€”still very far off, in fact, but meeting Efe, then  Joseph Maxwell, and being involved with the Gathering awakened something in me that laid dead for so long.",
